In the first week, the team focused on better organizing their tasks. Each member began by beginning their research on the assigned topic and began preparing in more detail the study materials they will use throughout the project. We meticulously plan to adhere to the Gantt Chart, which can be found in the last slides of the downloadable file on the Home Page.
