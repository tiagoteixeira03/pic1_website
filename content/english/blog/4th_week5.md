#### Final Tests

<div style="text-align: justify;">

This week, final tests commenced. The tests proposed by the team and scheduled for execution include Navigation in the testbed:

- To a random waypoint without dynamic obstacles.

- To a random waypoint with a dynamic obstacle (e.g., a person walking).

- To a random waypoint with a small obstacle that 2D navigation does not avoid (e.g., sponge).

- From the kitchen to the living room, ensuring the robot avoids complex 2D navigation furniture (e.g., tables with center legs, chairs without back legs).

The students will repeat each experiment five to ten times, recording collisions and successes, and performing a statistical analysis for both the current method and the one developed by the PIC1 team. The tests are scheduled to conclude next week; however, the team is encountering issues with the TIAGo robot, as the torso motor is malfunctioning, which affects the robot's ability to navigate.
