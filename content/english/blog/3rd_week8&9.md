#### Mid-Program Pitch Deck

<div style="text-align: justify;">

During these two weeks, students were on their midterm break and exam season. Due to the amount of time invested by students in studying for other subjects, the team did not make any advancements regarding the scope of this project.

However, the team did have their presentation of the Mid-Program Pitch during the week of exam preparation.

#### Website

Additionally, students also made progress on the development of the website, focusing mainly on the "Home" page (where they added the technology used and partners of the project) and the "Project" page (which provides an overall explanation of the project, its requirements, and how the team will test and validate their approach), as well as the footer of the website.
