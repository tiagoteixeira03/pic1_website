We're a dynamic team within the ElectroCap Program, an initiative from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (DEEC) under the First Cycle Capstone Project (PIC1). Focused on improving 2D navigation for autonomous domestic mobile robots, our project involves installing a 3D LiDAR system. Committed to applying our first-cycle knowledge to real-world challenges, we aspire to contribute to personal growth and technological advancements for the benefit of society.
