I am a third-year student pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at IST, Lisbon.

I am seeking internship programs that align with my field of study, as well as engaging projects and volunteer initiatives where I can apply my skills and make a meaningful impact.

One of my core values is continuous learning. I enjoy learning and working with people. I always strive to do better, both academically and professionally.
